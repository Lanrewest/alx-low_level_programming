The worst-case time complexity of a linear search in an array is O(n), where n is the size of the array. This means that the time it takes to search for a specific element in the array increases linearly with the size of the array. In the worst-case scenario, the algorithm will have to search through every element in the array before finding the element it's looking for or determining that the element isn't present in the array.

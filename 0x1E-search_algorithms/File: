The time complexity (worst case) of a binary search algorithm in an array of size n is O(log n). This is because in each iteration of the algorithm, the search space is divided in half, reducing the number of elements to search by half. As a result, the number of iterations required to find the target element is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the array. This makes binary search a very efficient algorithm for searching in large, sorted arrays

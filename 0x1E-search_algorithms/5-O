The space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n is O(1), which means it requires a constant amount of additional space. This is because the algorithm only needs to keep track of a few indices and variables, and the space required does not increase with the size of the input array. Therefore, the space complexity of a binary search is considered to be very efficient

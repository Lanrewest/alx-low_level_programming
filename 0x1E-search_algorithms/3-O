The space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n is O(1), which means that the space used by the algorithm is constant and independent of the size of the input array. This is because the algorithm only needs a few constant-size variables to keep track of the loop index and the search value. Therefore, the space used by the algorithm does not grow as the size of the input array grows.
